Random repo of miscellaneous stuff and notes picked up.

## SafeNet eToken
I have a SafeNet eToken that I use to securely create keys, store certificates, etc, etc. It's a USB based 2-factor authentication token with smart-card tech inside. [SafeNet eToken 5100](http://www.safenet-inc.com/multi-factor-authentication/authenticators/pki-usb-authentication/etoken-5100-usb-token/)

The SafeNet dir holds some scripts and notes I found/made and used when setting it up.
